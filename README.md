# Factorio Mod: Transparent Inventory

![Thumbnail](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/patschi/factorio-transparent-inventory/master/thumbnail.png "Thumbnail")

This is a simple [Factorio](https://www.factorio.com/) mod which makes all inventories transparent for all players. This way any player is able to open inventories of other players using ALT + MOUSE-CLICK-1 (*on by default*), just like admins on multiplayer servers can do. However when this mod is active, players do not need admin permissions to be able to do that and also the owner is informed (*on by default*) when somewhen opens his personal inventory.

Probably most useful on smaller multiplayer servers with people you trust.

## Features

- Open inventories of all players, without admin permissions
- Allowing to change the hotkey to look in other inventories
- Language support for English and German
- **Admin**: Ability to deactivate this mod in the mod settings
- **Admin**: Ability to turn off messages to inventory owners

## Requirements

- Factorio multiplayer server
- More than one active player to have inventories to look into
- Running Factorio 0.17 and later

## Credits
