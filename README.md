# Factorio Mod: Transparent Inventory

![Thumbnail](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/patschi/factorio-transparent-inventory/master/thumbnail.png "Thumbnail")

This is a simple [Factorio](https://www.factorio.com/) mod ([also available on mods.factorio.com](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/transparent-inventory)) which makes all inventories transparent for all players. This way any player is able to **open inventories of other players using ALT + MOUSE-CLICK-1** (*default*), just like admins on multiplayer servers can do. However when this mod is active, **players do not need admin permissions** to be able to do that and additionally the owner is informed (*enabled by default*) when somewhen opens his personal inventory.

This helps sharing resources with friends without figgling around with temporary chests, nor wasting valuable time trying to communicate which or how many resources exactly your friends needs to be productive. This way your friends can simply take everything they need* **to be more productive than ever before!**

Probably most useful on smaller multiplayer servers with people you trust.
