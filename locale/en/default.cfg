[mod-setting-description]
tinv-is-enabled=This easily allows enabling or disabling the complete mod, without requiring the mod to be removed from the server. Default is enabled.
tinv-tell-stalker=Usually when some player opens the inventory of any other player, the owner of the inventory is being informed via console message which player access his inventory. When disabled, this does not happen. Default is enabled.
tinv-users-mode=The mode which players should have access to inventories of other players. When using "Only listed users" only listed users at "Defined users list" are allowed to open inventories. When using "All users, except listed ones" (default) all players are allowed to do so, except listed ones.
tinv-users-list=A defined list of players, separated by comma (,). Important to notice: Case-insensitive and use of wildcards is only possible when regex is disabled! Wildcard works using an asterisk (*), so for example super* also matches superman and supergirl. Default is empty.
tinv-users-list-regex=For advanced users it is possible to enable regex support for the user lists. Multiple regex strings possible. Important: When enabling regex, the values are case-sensitive and the wildcard using asterisk (for easier use) will be disabled. Wildcards in Lua are usually .*. Please also notice that Lua regex is quite different from other programming languages, therefore please see further information in the Lua documentation. Default is disabled.
